# Hand-Gesture-Game-Controller
Hand Gesture Game Controller is a fun project that lets you control games using simple hand gestures. By tracking your index finger with a webcam, it detects swipes to trigger arrow key inputs. Built using Python, MediaPipe, OpenCV, and PyAutoGUI, it creates an intuitive and hands-free way to interact with games.
